# Salesforce

I work as a Salesforce Admin/Developer, and bring software engineering best practices and problem-solving appraoches to the ecosystem. I have a deep interest in DevOps practices, open-source tooling, and integrations with cloud service providers.

# Go

I'm learning Go because most of the Cloud Native technology is written in it. I want to gain a better understanding of how they work, and I want to be able to contribute to their development in the future. 

I try to do some work on Exercism every day. You can follow my progress and see my solutions [here.](https://exercism.org/profiles/mischavandenburg)
